## 🧙‍♀️ Creating and Using a New Character

PetGPT allows you to create fully customizable characters powered by different AI models. Here's how to create and interact with your own unique chatbot companion.

---

### 1. Add a New Character

Click the ➕ **Add Chatbot** button from the top toolbar.

![Add Character Screen](https://i.imgur.com/aGyQh6f.png)

Fill in the fields:

- **Name**: Set a unique name for your character (e.g., `JulesLiu`).

#### 🖼️ Character Image Format

To enable expressive reactions during conversation, your image should follow this format:

- **Dimensions**: `1024 x 1024` pixels
- **Layout**: A 2x2 grid with **four facial expressions** arranged:
  
  | Expression | Position        |
  |------------|-----------------|
  | Neutral    | Top-left        |
  | Happy      | Top-right       |
  | Thinking   | Bottom-left     |
  | Angry      | Bottom-right    |

Example:

### 3. Start Chatting!

![Chat With Chatbot](https://i.imgur.com/d5ZY2Yg.png)

At the top of the chat panel you’ll see a row of tabs—one for each active character session, plus a “+” button to open a new one. Click a character’s tab to switch into **that session and load all messages saved since this window was opened** (not your entire chat history).

Once a tab is selected:  
- The main area shows the character’s avatar and the conversation you’ve had in this session.  
- If available, quick‑reply suggestions will pop up in a “Quick reply” box just above the input field.

Below the chat window is your input area and a toolbar of buttons:

| Icon | Label   | Function                                                                 |
|------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🌐   | Agent   | Toggle **Agent mode** for system‑driven tasks or workflows               |
| 📄   | Memory  | Open the **Memory** panel to review or edit what the assistant remembers|
| 🔗   | Share   | Generate a shareable link to this conversation                           |
| 🔍   | Search  | Perform a web search from inside the chat                                |
| QT   | QT menu | Open the **Quick Tools** menu for quick reply                            |
| ➤   | Send    | Send your message (or press Enter)                                       |

Just type your message in the box at the bottom and hit Enter or click the send arrow. Your character will reply in their own style, complete with changing facial expressions and moods.  

Characters will respond in their own style, complete with facial expressions and moods based on their personality and tone.

### ✨ Tip: Show/Hide PetGPT Anytime

Use the following shortcut to quickly toggle the PetGPT interface:

⇧ Shift + Space ｜ Ctrl + Shift + Space (Or you can set them in settings page)

### 4. Fullscreen Mode & Conversation History

Click the ⬜ **Expand** button at the top of the chat window to enter fullscreen mode.

![Fullscreen Mode](https://i.imgur.com/JasHJSX.png)

In fullscreen mode, you gain access to:

- 🕰️ **Conversation History**: All your past interactions are neatly listed on the left side, labeled by their latest message or topic. This allows you to quickly revisit earlier discussions.
- 📂 **Multi-Chat Management**: Easily switch between chats with different characters.
- 📌 **Persistent Memory**: Each conversation retains its own context, so your character remembers what’s been said in that specific session.

This makes PetGPT ideal for both quick one-off chats and long-running dialogues.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Guide

This section explains how to set up the development environment, run the app in development mode, and build it for production.

### 📁 Project Structure

The project has two main directories in the root:

```
.
├── electron     # Electron main process (desktop wrapper & backend)
├── frontend     # React-based frontend interface
```

Detailed structure:

```
electron/
├── assets/         # Character images, models, and static assets
├── dist/           # Compiled Electron build output
├── models/         # Model configuration and local model data
├── node_modules/
├── main.js         # Electron entry point
├── preload.js      # Context bridge for frontend-electron communication
├── package.json
├── yarn.lock

frontend/
├── dist/           # Compiled frontend output (used by Electron)
├── public/         # Public static files
├── src/
│   ├── assets/     # Static images, styles

### 📦 Install Dependencies

Install dependencies in the following order:

```bash
# 1. Root dependencies
yarn install

# 2. Electron dependencies
cd electron
yarn install

# 3. Frontend dependencies
cd ../frontend
yarn install
```

---

### 🧪 Start in Development Mode

To run the application locally:

```bash
cd electron
yarn dev
```

This starts the Electron shell and loads the frontend from the `frontend/dist` directory.

> ⚠️ Make sure the frontend has been built at least once before running.

---

### 🏗️ Build for Production

From the root directory, build and package the app with:

```bash
yarn build     # Builds the frontend (React)
yarn dist      # Builds the Electron app for macOS (default)
```

#### 🪟 Windows Build

To build a Windows 64-bit executable:

```bash
yarn dist:win64
```

> 💡 Requires Windows or proper cross-platform setup with `wine` on macOS/Linux.
